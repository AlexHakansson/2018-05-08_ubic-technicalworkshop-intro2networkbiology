# Introduction to Network Biology

## 0. Set-Up
Please have the following packages/software installed prior to attending the workshop:

* Jupyter Notebooks
* Cytoscape
* networkx

## 1. Introduction to Cytoscape

1. Let's import a basic network into Cytoscape.  To do this, paste the networkâ€™s
[URL](http://www.ndexbio.org/#/network/2b2e62ef-392a-11e8-8695-0ac135e8bacf?accesskey=0c7ae1bef2ce580dd23584d532304fe6756ebc8aa2d86c121df8dca31a04cc2a) into the NDEx search widget in the Network Control Panel at the upper left of the Cytoscape window, and
then click on the Search icon.

2. Apply layouts and styles to visualize this network. Distinguish between proteins, small molecules, and RNAs. Also distinguish between directed and undirected edges. Use [Cytoscape's tutorial](https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/modules/mapping-data/#/) to learn how to do this. *Tip: Install yFiles layouts in the `Layout` tab*

3. Create an [NDEx](http://www.home.ndexbio.org/create-an-ndex-account/) account, and export your network to it. Go to `File->Export->Network to NDEx`. Click on the anonymous account in the upper right, then the Add Account button. Enter your NDEx username and password leaving the NDEx server field blank.
